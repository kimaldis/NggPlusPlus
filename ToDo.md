NggPlusPlus ToDo list
=====================

* catch errors in JSON:decode() in Post() more betterer
* first  gallery that's created when the pub serv is first created. Dammit
* tags, metadata on image publish, with radio button for metadata
* there may be an issue with sorting. Check.


* metadata on upload - titles, name, keywords, etc
* when an image is created the full sized url is used for the thumburl. I've hacked in a temporary fix but it should be looked at properly
* when the publish service is first created it includes a publish collection this should be created in NG.
* location of NG's gallery folder is hardcoded. We should get it from Wordpress
* not seeing any errors when creating albums &  galleries when the remote server can't be reached??
* option to delete all albums & galleries when the service is deleted.
* when a collection tree is being deleted, if a delete of one of the children fails, the delete dies leaving remaining galleries or albums un-deleted
